## What Makes 925 Silver Jewelry So Special?
You might have noticed the term “925 silver” mentioned across many jewelry descriptions. But what does it mean?

Simply put, 925 silver is a high-quality alloy made of 92.5% pure silver and 7.5% other metals (usually copper) that give the piece strength and durability. Pure silver is too soft for daily wear, which is why sterling silver (925) is the preferred choice for making long-lasting, elegant jewelry.

It’s hypoallergenic, resistant to tarnish with proper care, and shines brilliantly — making it ideal for everything from casual wear to gifting.
